You only need to install a package once, but you need to reload it every time
If we need to be explicit about where a function (or dataset) comes from,
weâ€™ll use the special form package::function()

A data frame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows).
mpg contains observations collected by the US Environment Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

To plot mpg, run this code to put displ on the x-axis and hwy on the y-axis:

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplot(data = mpg) creates an empty graph
geom_point() adds a layer of points to your plot

ggplot(data = <DATA>) +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
