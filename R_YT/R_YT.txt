can also use sum() on a logical vector;
it simply counts the number of vector elements that are TRUE

winning_scores <- player[player > house]

#creating matrix: start with vector

matrix(v, nrow=3, ncol=4)

rbind() function to paste together different vectors as if they were rows of a matrix

rownames(my_matrix) <- row_names_vector
colnames(star_wars_matrix) <- c("US", "non-US")

#constructs a matrix with the number 1 up to 9, filled row by row:
matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)

#Another way to name my_matrix
col <- c("US", "non-US")
row <- c("A New Hope", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Return of the Jedi")

                           byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3, dimnames = list(row, col))

matrix(0, 3, 4) all zeros

matrix(11:13, 3, 4) gives us columns of 11 12 13

dim(m) gives us num of rows and columns
length(m) # elements in entire matrix
head(m) up to six rows in top of matrix
tail(m) up to six rows in bottom of matrix
rowSums() calculates the totals for each row of a matrix.
colSums()
cbind(matrix 1, vector 1) merges matrices and/or vectors together by column

tail(m, 1) changes # of rows we get back
all_wars_matrix <- rbind(star_wars_matrix, star_wars_matrix2) gives us 6 rows

#select 1 or more elements of matrix
  m <- matrix(1:12, 3, 4)
  m[2,4] element in 2nd row and 4th column
  m[2, ] get all columns
  m[1:2, 4] rows 1 and 2, column 4
  m[1:2, 3:4] gives us sub matrix
  m[c(1,4), c(2,3)]
  star_wars_matrix[c("Return of the Jedi","The Empire Strikes Back"),c("US", "non-US") ]
    same as: star_wars_matrix[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE), ]

# Manipulating Data

dplyr package
  has five main functions, or "verbs", that each correspond to a common data manipulation task.
  select() selects columns from your dataframe and returns another dataframe
  %>% doing away with nested function calls taxis %>% select()
taxis_geo <- taxis %>% select(pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude, dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude, trip_distance)
# all dplyr functions, the first argument is the dataframe and subsequent arguments are the names of the columns you want

select(-column) to get rid of columns
taxis_smaller <- taxis %>%
  select(-VendorID, -rate, -store_and_fwd_flag)

# Create taxis_numeric
taxis_numeric <- taxis %>% select_if(is.numeric)
# instead of passing the names of columns in, you pass in a function that that is run on each column and that evaluates to TRUE or FALSE
# Output the correlation matrix
cor(taxis_numeric)

mutate() #creating a few columns you're interested in examining, but aren't present in your original dataset
# first argument of the function mutate() is the dataframe that you're working with. Subsequent arguments have the form new_col_name = new_col_expr

# Add trip_distance_kms
taxis_with_kms <- taxis %>%
  mutate(trip_distance_kms = trip_distance * 1.609)

# Add cost_per_mile
taxis_with_cost_mile <- taxis %>%
  mutate(cost_per_mile = total_amount / trip_distance)

hav_dist() #computes distance using the Haversine formula

# Create my_distance and diff
taxis_my_dist <- taxis  %>%
  mutate(my_distance = hav_dist(pickup_longitude,
                                pickup_latitude,
                                dropoff_longitude,
                                dropoff_latitude),

# Find the min and the max of my_distance
min(taxis_my_dist$diff)
max(taxis_my_dist$diff)

filter()
# Create taxis_standard_rate
taxis_standard_rate <- filter(taxis, rate == "Standard rate")

# Check the size of the dataframes
dim(taxis)
dim(taxis_standard_rate)

# Filter taxis
taxis_groups <- taxis %>%
  filter(passenger_count > 1)

group_by(), which groups the data; takes a dataframe and names of columns that define groups
summarize() which summarizes the groups; need expression that aggregates the rows of the data to a single value

# Group and summarize the data
taxis %>% group_by(passenger_count) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), mean_cost = mean(total_amount))
_______________________________________________________
# Visualizing Data

#The function ggplot() with the data as the first argument.
#The second argument is a set of aesthetic mappings.
#These are arguments to the aes() function and take the form aesthetic = variable.
#The most common aesthetics you'll want to include are x and y.
#These map data points to positions on the x and y-axes

geom_point() draws a point and geom_line() draws a line.
geoms are added to plots using the + sign

ggplot(my_data, aes(x = x_coord, y = y_coord)) +
  geom_point()

# Plot a histogram of total fares
ggplot(taxis,aes(x = total_amount)) +
    geom_histogram()

# Filter the data
taxis_tolls <- filter(taxis, tolls_amount > 0)

# Plot a histogram of tolls

    facet_wrap(~ passenger_count)
# facet_grid() to create a facet for each combination of the levels of two categorical variables.
